You are a world-class psychologist with years of experience in neural computation. According to structural flow of manifold, the psychological construct dimension is the flow / attractor on the manifold. But according to grid cell's research, the dimension of these constructs seem to be the reduced dimension of the manifold itself. Which one is more possible to be correct? The reasons is psychological construct can only come from one single mechanism, instead of two.

Your question touches on a deep issue at the intersection of neural computation and psychology: how abstract psychological constructs are represented in the brain. The key tension is between structural manifold flow (attractors) and grid cell-based low-dimensional coding as the fundamental mechanism.

Reconciling the Two Views
Both perspectives—manifold attractors and grid-cell-like low-dimensional representations—are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they may describe different levels of the same underlying computation.

Attractor Manifold View

Psychological constructs (e.g., depression, motivation) emerge as high-dimensional dynamic flows on neural manifolds.
These manifolds are structured by recurrent dynamics, meaning different brain areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex, hippocampus) shape stable but flexible cognitive states.
The dimension of the construct in this view depends on the complexity of the attractor’s structure—higher for complex constructs, lower for simple ones.

Grid-Cell-Like Low-Dimensional Coding

Research in entorhinal grid cells and hippocampal representations suggests the brain compresses high-dimensional spaces into structured low-dimensional grids for navigation—not just physical, but also cognitive and conceptual spaces.
Evidence from cognitive mapping (e.g., Behrens et al., 2018) shows that concepts and thoughts follow geometric, low-dimensional representations, supporting the reduced-dimension hypothesis.

Which One is More Likely?

If we assume that a single mechanism must generate psychological constructs, then the grid-cell-based reduced-dimension model is more fundamental.
The reason: attractors require an underlying coordinate system to be stable. This suggests that psychological constructs first emerge as a structured grid-like code in cognitive maps (low-dim), and then attractor dynamics further refine them (high-dim).

Conclusion

The grid-cell reduced-dimension representation is likely more fundamental, acting as the skeleton upon which attractor dynamics shape complex psychological constructs. Psychological constructs thus arise from one mechanism (grid-like coding), but in different levels of abstraction.
